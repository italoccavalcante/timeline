# Timeline

# About the Project

This project represents a set of horizontal timelines with events on ordered dates.

# How to run the project
```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/italoccavalcante/timeline.git

# enter the project folder called 'my-portfolio'
cd timeline

# install dependencies
yarn install / npm install

# run the project
yarn start / npm run start
```
  
## What would you do differently
- I wouldn't have spent so much time analyzing the initial project code.
- I would have chosen a simpler timeline layout to implement.
- I would have migrated to TypeScript
- Before starting the implementation, I would have researched external libraries for using the drag-in-drop feature(for example).
  
## How did you make your design decisions?
I searched for examples of horizontal timelines on Google Images
